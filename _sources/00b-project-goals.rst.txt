Project goals
=============

The central focus of project fluvius aims to understand the response of river basins after forest disturbance and restoration. Several other goals are also noted in the advancement of remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and ecosystem monitoring. 

Project goals:

- Co-development of an automated pipeline for core datasets, preprocessing, and storage on a cloud based platform  
- Prototyping of various experimental deep learning models to analyze remote sensed images of rainforest watersheds and estimate the total suspended sediment (TSS)
- Diagnose the deep learning model on field based measurements and compare to performance of current state-of-the-art spectral based models
- Deploy the deep learning model API on the Itacai√∫nas River watershed over space and time

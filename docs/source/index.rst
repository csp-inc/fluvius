Welcome to the fluvius documentation!
=====================================

.. important::

    This documentation was generated on |today|, and is rebuilt on push events 
    to the main branch.

Project Fluvius uses satellite imagery and AI to monitor the health of rivers in
the Amazon and the U.S. by enabling near real-time prediction of suspended
sediment concentration. This website serves as documetation for the code in the
project's `GitHub repository <https://github.com/csp-inc/fluvius>`_. The web app
can be viewed `here <https://fluviuswebapp.z22.web.core.windows.net>`_.

In the following sections, we provide an introduction to the project, and setup
information.

The following command line scripts represent the building blocks of the fluvius
workflow. These scripts are meant to be run in the order specified by the
numeric prefix in the filenames. All of these files can be found in 'bin/', and 
should be executed from from the Fluvius repo's root directory (e.g.
:code:`python3 bin/01-usgs-station-acquire.py`)

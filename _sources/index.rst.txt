=======

.. important::

    This documentation was generated on |today|, and is rebuilt on push events 
    to the main branch.

Fluvius is a collaboration between the `Analytics Lab at Conservation Science
Partners <https://analytics-lab.org/>`_, the `Instituto Tecnologico Vale <www.itv.org>`_, 
and `Microsoft Brazil <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth>`_. Project Fluvius 
uses satellite imagery and AI to monitor the health of rivers in
the Amazon and the U.S. by enabling prediction of suspended sediment concentration. 
This website serves as documetation for the code in the
project's `GitHub repository <https://github.com/csp-inc/fluvius>`_. The web app
can be viewed `here <https://fluviuswebapp.z22.web.core.windows.net>`_.

In the following sections, we provide an introduction to the project, and setup
information.

The following command line scripts represent the building blocks of the fluvius
workflow. These scripts are meant to be run in the order specified by the
numeric prefix in the filenames. All of these files can be found in 'bin/', and 
should be executed from the Fluvius repo's root directory (e.g.
:code:`python3 bin/01-usgs-station-acquire.py`)
